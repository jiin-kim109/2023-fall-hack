## Short Description
NewLeafNavi is a web-based AI application designed to help users find ideal locations to begin a fresh chapter in their lives while traveling. When users initiate the program, it gathers their personal preferences across various categories to create a personalized travel plan. Subsequently, the AI presents a map displaying the top travel destinations based on the collected data.
